# Advent of Code 2023

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). They are neither meticulously tested nor polished, they were just working well enough for the purpose of the event. Some may provide only part of the answer, or a bit of manual labor is required for the solution. "a" is for part 1, "b" is for part 2, "c" is both combined.
